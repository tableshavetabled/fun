# Time to make a game!

## Rules:
1. Do not change the MASTER_SCRIPT file on the main branch!!! Always create a PULL REQUEST so that we can review changes before merging to master branch. When you edit the file and go down to the bottom to commit changes, do so on a NEW branch, then create a pull request for that branch so we can approve changes together.
2. Make sure to put FOUR SPACES inside of the label, NOT TAB!! Will not build in RenPy with tabs and will have to manually fix everything
3. Copy Pasting from Google Docs will mess up the " ", you will need to CTRL + F find and replace all  " ". Copy the " that is pasted in, then in the replace bar, type in the " as normal, then replace all and repeat this for the other side of the quotation marks and it will fix this.
