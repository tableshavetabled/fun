# Time to make a game!

## Rules:
1. Do not change the MASTER_SCRIPT file on the main branch!!! Always create a PULL REQUEST so that we can review changes before merging to master branch. When you edit the file and go down to the bottom to commit changes, do so on a NEW branch, then create a pull request for that branch so we can approve changes together.
2. That's pretty much it so far
